# barbell-tracker V1
doesn't actually use mustache yet, will eventually probably when I make the settings page (so can load pages with
different options)

try it: barbell-tracker.herokuapp.com

This project was #1 a project with which to learn about web development and #2 the workout app I wanted for myself,
simple, least clicking possible, and no fancy stuff.
