3/14: basic page functionality, no server, pictures don't change
  //get 1pl8-4pl8 pics to switch with
  //use GIMP to add words to them
  eventually try to make all the images I need? (broken bar image above 765)
    each pl8 requires 18 more images

3/15-3/16: page works
  steps:
    //1. make all placeholder images upto 4pl8, like 70
	2b. Learn about local storage object and use this to run
	whole app in client side (including data persistance)
		//- design my data objects and store them in localStorage with
		JSON.stringify()
		- use this data to make history page work!
		- when switching exercises query for last lift of that type and
		preload weight and reps
    2. start server side
    3. CSS and layout
    //4. add new exercises

Problems: jquery.val() chops off string at first space, ask SO
          barbell image reloads but currWeight doesn't on page reload
            currWeight and image is buggy on page reload
                can't fix this, change isn't running??? now on reload just reset weights, the pre-load
                will make UX better

3/22:
    //fix history to show in lift : reps x weight format
    //persist new lifts added
    **grab last reps and weight for given lift and auto fill page
        easy way: every time a set is added save to 'last'+liftName the reps and weight
        and query this every time the lift name changes
    work on layout?
    serve client side on Heroku?
    read more of book (client side and server side chapter)?
        start server side?
        eventually want local storage to just be within current session and have an actual db

Things for Settings:
    clear history
    remove lifts from list
    kg/lb
    change bar weight?
