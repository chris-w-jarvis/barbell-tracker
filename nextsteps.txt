3/14: basic page functionality, no server, pictures don't change
  //get 1pl8-4pl8 pics to switch with
  //use GIMP to add words to them
  eventually try to make all the images I need? (broken bar image above 765)
    each pl8 requires 18 more images

3/15-3/16: page works
  steps:
    //1. make all placeholder images upto 4pl8, like 70
    2. start server side OR make a full workout session work
    3. CSS and layout
    //4. add new exercises

Problems: jquery.val() chops off string at first space, ask SO
          barbell image reloads but currWeight doesn't on page reload
          hiding and showing currWeight is buggy
